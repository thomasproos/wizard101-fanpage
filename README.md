## Wizard101 Fan Website
Written by Thomas Roos

## Project Description
This is a website dedicated to the game Wizard101, a long-time fan I've always wanted to express my creativity through the form of website creation.
I created this website with the intent of exploring web design and asset creation/modification. I've listed a bunch of figures below that showcase the website
and its different pages. The website is intended to allows users to optimize their in-game experience by providing an interactive and easy-to-use inventory 
system that lets them search for their preffered gear and optimize their stats accordingly.
